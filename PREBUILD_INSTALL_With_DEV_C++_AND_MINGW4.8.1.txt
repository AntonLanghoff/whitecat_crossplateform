-Install MinGW with GCC4.8.1 in C:/MinGW with all the basic package, with the mingw-get-setup.exe
-install Dev-Cpp 5.6.1 No Compiler Setup.exe

-clone inside the whitecat_crossplateform folder the whitecatbuild and whitecatlib repository at https://github.com/ChristophGuillermet/whitecatbuild and https://github.com/ChristophGuillermet/whitecatlib
or get directly the lighter prebuild "MinGW4.8.1Devit.zip" and copy the content of the zip inside the new whitecat_crossplateform folder.

-open dev c++
-in the Tools/Compiler Options create a compiler and name it MinGW: 
add in MinGW compiler tab Directories
Binaries to C:\MinGW\bin
Librairies to C:\MinGW\lib
C Includes to C:\MinGW\include
C++ Includes to C:\MinGW\include

In the Programs tab
add all the programme in C:\MinGW\bin
gcc = gcc.exe
g++ = g++.exe
make = mingw32-make.exe
gdb = gdb.exe
windres = windres.exe
dllwrap = dllwrap.exe
gprof = gprof.exe

in the Makefile tab uncheck Use fast but imperfect dependency generation

open WhiteCat_crossplateform_with_relativ_lib.dev in IDE/DEV-C++
and in the Project Options/Compiler select MinGW

Click Compile and run 

the clean and rebuild fonction bug in devc++ because of mingw32-make used as makefile. I do not find already why. It is recommended to use codeblocks.
